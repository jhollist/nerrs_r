# Introduction to R: Northeast National Estuarine Research Reserve

This repository contains materials for an Introduction to R class.  The materials were originally delivered as a one day workshop but are being amended to a one hour class format.  On top of this, we are experimenting with doing this as a webinar as a result of the current pandemic.  Expect the content and schedules to change.

The materials will cover:

- Working with RStudio
- R Syntax
- Packages
- Data Types and Data Structures
- Reading in external data
- Basic Data Manipulation
- Basic Data Visualization.

# Class Schedule and Links to Materials
We will meet every Monday from 2pm to 3pm via Teams ([link to Teams meeting](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_N2I1N2U4OWYtMWM1MC00MjRhLWFlNWQtMjQzMzc1MmEyOTI4%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%2288b378b3-6748-4867-acf9-76aacbeca6a7%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%2290904e2a-aa82-465e-9922-afce4bc6d524%22%7d))
