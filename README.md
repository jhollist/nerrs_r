# Introduction to R: Experimental One Hour Class Format

This repository contains materials for an Introduction to R class.  The materials were originally delivered as a one day workshop but are being amended to a one hour class format.  On top of this, we are experimenting with doing this as a webinar as a result of the current pandemic.  Expect the content and schedules to change,

The materials will cover:

- Working with RStudio
- R Syntax
- Packages
- Data Types and Data Structures
- Reading in external data
- Basic Data Manipulation
- Basic Data Visualization.
